# FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions

## Where's my ticket to the hackathon?
We had an extensive *application* process that was detailed by Quincy on at https://hackathon.freecodecamp.org/ . If you *successfully* completed this process, and you were *one of the first 300 to do so* (for the in-person event), then you were sent a ticket to the email address provided in your application. If you do not have a ticket then you cannot attend the in-person hackathon. But you are welcome to join the online hackathon.

## What is the JAMstack?
The JAMstack is a powerful new approach for deploying fast, highly scalable sites and applications that don't require backend infrastructure. Thanks to recent advancements in the web platform, developers can now run any web property, from simple sites to complex applications, on global CDNs and without a single web server. Learn more about how the JAMstack works [here](https://jamstackconf.com/what-is-jamstack).

## Can the online participants and in-person participants be on the same team?
Unfortunately no. This makes things needlessly complicated. Further, there are separate prizes and judging protocol for the online and in-person hackathon. If we discover that your in-person team has online collaborators, you will be disqualified.

## Can the online/in-person hackers still chat?
Of course. We're all in the same Discord chat group. And since this hackathon is largely about education, the in-person/online groups should both help each other out by answering questions.

## Where is the Discord Channel?
